# UE5 3D Platformer -- Sprint 1

This repository contains the project developed during the first sprint
at **Epitech Berlin**, where we were tasked with creating a 3D
platformer in **Unreal Engine 5** over the course of 6 weeks.

## 🎮 Gameplay & Mechanics

Our game includes a variety of mechanics to make the platforming
experience more engaging and fun: - **Shooting** - **Grapple system** -
**Mines used as jump pads** - **Basic traversal**: running, jumping,
sliding, etc.

## 📦 Required Asset Packs

The project relies on several free asset packs. If you want to open and
run the project in **UE5** (not just play the build), make sure to
